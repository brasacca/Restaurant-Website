I think the website was well thought out. It has a simplistic feel and doesn't show you any unessary information. Everything that is listed (hours, contact information, menu)
is there for you to see. I thought that the order form for the food was really well done. It is neatly aligned and includes all the options that would be needed.

I think it was a good idea to add a background image to the home page and I wish I would have done something like that for my site.

I mention this below but I had an issue with the buttons to navigate through the site so I had to navigate by manually opening the separate file pages. I do not know if this was an issue on my end but I offered a solution below which fixed my problem. If
you didn't have this issue then you can ignore it. With that problem being fixed, I think this site has a great user experience. It is easy to navigate to the order page and it's very easy to fill out the order form.

I think that both of our codebases would be very maintable as we both have well structured folders and limited the amount of code we had in each file.

The code is well structured within files. There was not any duplicate and uncessary code. The directories are also well organized with images being in the images folder as well as CSS files being placed in the CSS files.

On the homepage, I do not know if it was an issue with how I downloaded the repository but the "order here" button was not navigating me to the menu page. The html code for the button was: <button onclick="location.href='/menu.html'" >Order Here!</button>
I altered it to: <button onclick="location.href='menu.html';" >Order Here!</button> and it seemed to navigate me there.

If there is one thing I would change with the CSS, I would create a separate CSS file for the common theme that is on every page. Using one file for that theme would reduce CSS duplication.
