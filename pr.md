  Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I think this person's codebase would be more maintainable. We both did similar things with our codebases but overall, I think her's is a little more organized and than mine.

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
  if not, suggest some specific improvements
    I think the code is very well structures and organized. It was easy to find everything that I was looking for.
  
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
  No other issues but I would have used a media query on the menu page so the two options stack on top of each other when the page width gets smaller!
  
  were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Yes, I thought they used semantically appropriate elements
  
  is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes but I think there could have been a common navigation css file that would have helped to limit duplication some more.
  
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
  Nope, I think they did an awesome job on their website and I love how it turned out!
